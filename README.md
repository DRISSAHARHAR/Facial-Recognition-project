# Facial-Recognition-project
This project implements a Facial Recognition System using a Siamese Neural Network (SNN). The system is designed to identify and verify individuals by comparing facial images.By leveraging a contrastive loss function and L1 distance, the model is able to learn to differentiate between similar and dissimilar faces.

Features:
Siamese Neural Network (SNN): A specialized neural network architecture designed for learning pairwise differences between two inputs, making it ideal for facial recognition tasks.
L1 Distance Layer: Custom implementation of an L1 distance layer to compute the absolute difference between the embeddings of two facial images.
Training Pipeline: A comprehensive training pipeline for learning the similarity between facial images, capable of handling large datasets.
Real-time Face Verification: Includes code for real-time face verification using a webcam or pre-recorded videos.
Model Loading and Inference: Provides easy-to-use scripts for loading the pre-trained model and running facial recognition on new images.
Evaluation: Tools for measuring the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and verification rate.

This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in facial recognition and verification, with a focus on building a robust and scalable system using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
